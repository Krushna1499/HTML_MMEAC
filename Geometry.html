                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p><strong>Geometry</strong> is one of the oldest branches of mathematics. It started with empirical recipes concerning shapes, such as lines, angles and circles, which were developed mainly for the needs of surveying and architecture, but has since blossomed out into many other subfields</p>

                <h2>Explanation</h2>
                <p><storng>Introduction to Geometry</strong>
Geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of shapes, sizes, angles, and properties of space. It is a fundamental area of mathematics that has applications in various fields, including architecture, engineering, art, and physics. The word "geometry" comes from the Greek words "geo" meaning "earth" and "metron" meaning "measurement," reflecting its origins in the measurement of land and construction.
<br><br>
<u>Core Concepts of Geometry:</u>
Points, Lines, and Planes:
<br>
Point: A point is a location in space with no size or dimension. It is represented by a dot and labeled with a capital letter.
Line: A line is a straight path that extends indefinitely in both directions. It is composed of an infinite number of points and is represented by a straight line with arrowheads at each end.
Plane: A plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely in all directions. It is represented by a shape that appears to be a flat sheet of paper.
<br><br>
Angles:
An angle is formed when two rays share a common endpoint, called the vertex of the angle. Angles are measured in degrees (°) or radians (rad) and are classified based on their size:
Acute Angle: An angle measuring less than 90 degrees.
Right Angle: An angle measuring exactly 90 degrees.
Obtuse Angle: An angle measuring more than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees.
Straight Angle: An angle measuring exactly 180 degrees.
Reflex Angle: An angle measuring more than 180 degrees but less than 360 degrees.
<br><br>
Polygons:
A polygon is a closed shape formed by straight line segments. Examples of polygons include triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons, etc.
Polygons are classified based on the number of sides they have. For example, a triangle has three sides, a quadrilateral has four sides, and so on.
<br><br>
Circles:
A circle is a set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point called the center. The distance from the center to any point on the circle is called the radius.
The circumference of a circle is the distance around its outer edge, and the diameter is the distance across the circle through its center.</p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Geometry is a fundamental branch of mathematics that studies the properties and relationships of shapes and space. By understanding geometric concepts and principles, we can solve problems, make informed decisions, and appreciate the beauty and symmetry of the world around us.</p>
